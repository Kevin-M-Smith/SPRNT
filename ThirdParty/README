To build the dynamically-linked library of UMFPACK and KLU, you need the following packages
from U Florida/CISE. Note the specific version numbers:

KLU-1.1.4
UMFPACK-5.1.0
AMD-2.2.1
BTF-1.1.3
COLAMD-2.7.4
UFconfig-3.7.1

Other versions probably will work, but I haven't tested them. If you want to try, you 
are on your own.

You can manually download the source code of the packages and drop them in the CMLIB
and UF direcotry. There are two scripts in the CMLIB and UF directory to download 
the source code from their websites. They are automatically envoked by "make dep"

CMLIB/fetch_cmlib.sh
UF/fetch_ufsparse.sh

Note that the UFconfig.mk file in UFconfig version 3.7.1 does not work properly. 
The script will replace it with a working version.

The URL's of the source code are subject to change. If the download scripts stop 
working, you can try to download them manually and update the scripts. If this happens,
I appreciate it if you can push the change back to me.
