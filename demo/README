SPRNT can be invoked through API (application programming interface). By using API, the
model developers have much more freedom to control the behavior of the simulation engine.
(But they also have more responsbility to make sure things are done correctly). As a 
matter of fact, the command-line version of SPRNT is simply a netlist parser on top of
a bunch of API calls to the library. The example here is a simple demonstration on how 
to get it done. Although the demo river network is hardcoded, it is quite possible to 
integrate SPRNT into a more comprehensive simulation framework so that the river network 
can be specified on the fly, simulated and analyzed, without even generate a file. 

A few things to watch out:

1. You have to provide the path to the solver dynamic library. After running "make install",
   the solver library should be in "lib/". One way to set up the search path is 
   "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib" or simply run "./run_demo.sh"

2. Make sure you run "make install" before trying the example in this directory. See above 
   for the reason.

3. Make sure that the node index starts from 0, and sequentially increase. (This is not an
   issue for the command-line command because a parser translates the node names to correct
   node indices)
